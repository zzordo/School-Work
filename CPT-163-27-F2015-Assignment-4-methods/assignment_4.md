#### Week 4 (Methods) Assignment
Two assignments ago we wrote a large conditional menu with 5 options. For this assignment you will take the body of each __case__ or __if__ and move it into a **Method** and then call that **Method** in its place. At the end you should have a unique function for each unique body in your menu.

Example
```
// if your menu option condition looked like this
if(option == 1){
  System.out.println("WOW great choice");
}

// You should rewrite it to call a method instead and move the logic that was // there into a function
if(option == 1){
  printGreatChoice();
}
```



**Hint** _You cannot nest a function definition inside a function definition so you will have to use the modifier **public static** on all of your methods_

You will submit this as a Pull Request to the repo WCCCEDU/CPT-163-27-F2015-Assignment-4-functions
