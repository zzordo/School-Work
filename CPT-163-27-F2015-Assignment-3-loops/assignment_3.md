#### Week 3 (Loops) Assignment
You will write a loop structure __while__ or __for__ that will reverse a string of your choosing.

This means you can get a string from the console using __Scanner__ or a predefined variable.

Example
```
"Welcome" => "emocleW"
```

Your string should be at least 5 characters long.

**Hint** _You will likely have to pull each character out of the string and then convert it from a character back into a String to accomplish this assignment. There is a method on String.**valueOf()** which accepts a character and returns a String for that character. There are other ways to do this but you can find the documentation inside your IDE to help learn how to use it._

You will submit this as a Pull Request to the repo WCCCEDU/CPT-163-27-F2015-Assignment-3-loops
